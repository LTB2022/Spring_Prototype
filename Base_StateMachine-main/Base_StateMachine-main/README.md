# Base_StateMachine
State machine that transition through the states needed to complete our proof of concept. Two button inputs are needed on digital pins D5 and D6.

Print statements are used as placeholders in which working content will be in integrated.

D5 functions as the primary path to navigate to task 1, also functions as a yes button.
D6 functions as the secondary path to navigate to task 2, also functions as a no button.

I didn't use buttons, but simply used a wire on each pin and applied it to ground to change states.
